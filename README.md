# SI671_Recommendation_System
Book Datasets Recommendation by three different strategies.

Recommender system or recommendation engine, a subclass of information filter- ing system, is a system that predicts the preferences of users and provides a list of recommendation items, aims to help users make appropriate decisions. In our study, we built three different kinds of recommendation engines and implement recommendations on books datasets. The three different strategies we used to build our models are collaborative filtering based on explicit rating interaction, content- based filtering based on books features, and a hybrid recommender based on both implicit rating interaction and books features. Specific evaluation methods have been used to judge the accuracy of each of these methods. Our result shows that both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering can provide good prediction, and hybrid recommender system could give higher quality recommendation.
